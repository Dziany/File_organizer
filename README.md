# 📂 Smart File Organizer

A lightweight and efficient Python utility that automatically organizes cluttered folders (like "Downloads") by sorting files into categorized subdirectories based on their extensions.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Auto-Categorization:** Pre-configured for Images, Documents, Archives, Installers, Audio, Video, and Development files.
- **JSON-Driven Configuration:** Easily customize file mappings in an external `config.json` file without modifying the core logic.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Includes `try-except` blocks to handle "Permission Denied" (files in use) and "File Already Exists" scenarios.
- **Pathlib Integration:** Built with modern Python `pathlib` for safe and cross-platform file system operations.
